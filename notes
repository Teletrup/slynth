set up vsmth
  n-root version?

global thingamajiggles problem
can't call draw from global event handlers
  can bind new event handlers on each render
    does it make stuff slow?

explicit check for handler initialization?
it's the same draw() after all, can bind it
seems finnicky though
a workaround for something that would be trivial in version with one global draw()
but does it really matter? normal event handlers get rebound on each rendering as well
document element isn't special


array of freqs for all midi notes
create and attach oscs on key_down
what about creating oscs? 
are unattached oscs slow?
you'd have to re-initialize them each time you change waveform
are they passively slow though?

note state
  velocity
  adsr

does MIDI signal release and stop separately?
